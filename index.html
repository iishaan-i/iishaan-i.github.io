        <p>A passionate explorer at the intersection of cognitive science, computer science, and machine learning. Let's connect: <a href="mailto:iinabath@andrew.cmu.edu">iinabath@andrew.cmu.edu</a></p>

    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a first-year student at Carnegie Mellon University, pursuing a BS in Cognitive Science and Computer Science, with an expected graduation in May 2029. My journey started in Frisco, Texas, where I graduated from Reedy High School in 2025, diving deep into advanced coursework like Calculus III, Differential Equations, AP Physics C, and AP Computer Science. Those early challenges sparked my love for problem-solving and the intricate dance between human cognition and computational systems.</p>
        <p>Outside the classroom, I'm driven by curiosity—whether it's building AI models that mimic biological processes or volunteering to shape youth leadership. I thrive on turning complex ideas into practical solutions, always with an eye toward positive impact.</p>

    <section id="education">
        <h2>My Educational Journey</h2>
        <p>At Carnegie Mellon, I'm building a strong foundation with courses in Cognitive Psychology, Math and Machine Learning. These build on my high school rigor, where I tackled everything from AP Biology to AP Statistics, honing my analytical skills.</p>
        <p>Before CMU, I completed the MITx MicroMasters in Statistics and Data Science in December 2023—a graduate-level adventure that immersed me in machine learning, probability, and statistical modeling through courses like "Machine Learning with Python" and "Fundamentals of Statistics." I also took Carnegie Mellon's Deep Learning Systems course in 2022, where I learned to implement algorithms from scratch, and HarvardX's CS50 series from 2021-2022, which introduced me to computer science, web programming, and AI with Python. Each step has been about bridging theory and real-world application, preparing me to tackle the unknowns in brain science and computation.</p>

    <section id="research">
        <h2>Research Adventures</h2>
        <p>Since January 2024, I've been a Machine Learning Research Intern at the Zhou Lab at UT Southwestern Medical Center, under the guidance of Dr. Jian Zhou and Dr. Kseniia Dudnyk. There, I created an interpretable deep learning model to predict transcription start site locations in Drosophila, uncovering how promoter motifs influence genetic expression. Currently, I'm training models to forecast enhancer-promoter interactions and DNase I Hypersensitive Sites, leveraging high-performance computing clusters with A100 and H100 GPUs for distributed training.</p>
        <p>This work has sharpened my skills in PyTorch, GPU computing, genomic sequence modeling, and data visualization—turning raw biological data into meaningful insights. It's exhilarating to contribute to fields that could reshape our understanding of genetics.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="projects">
        <h2>Key Projects That Shaped Me</h2>
        <p>In 2022, as part of CMU's Deep Learning Systems course, I built the Needle Deep Learning Library from the ground up— a PyTorch-like framework using Python, C++, and CUDA. I implemented automatic differentiation, optimizers like SGD and Adam, normalization layers, and GPU acceleration, culminating in adding Graph Neural Network support for classification tasks. It was a hands-on lesson in efficient tensor operations and tiled matrix multiplication.</p>
        <p>For the Texas JSHS in 2023 (where I placed in the Top 8 for Life Sciences), I developed a system for Single Cell Gene Expression Prediction, tackling high-dimensional datasets in computational biology. I combined ensemble methods with ML approaches for perturbation prediction and built an automated hyperparameter tuning pipeline using Optuna—blending PyTorch, HuggingFace, and statistical modeling.</p>
        <p>Earlier, in my MIT 6.86x final project, I created a Reinforcement Learning Game Agent, implementing Q-learning variants and Deep Q-Networks to build an autonomous agent in a text-based environment. These projects aren't just code; they're stories of perseverance and innovation.</p>

    <section id="honors">
        <h2>Honors and Recognition</h2>
        <p>Along the way, I've been fortunate to earn recognition that fuels my drive: National Merit Semifinalist in 2024, a MIT MicroMasters Program Letter in December 2023, Top 8 in Life Sciences at the Texas Junior Science & Humanities Symposium in 2024, the All Star Award from the US Army Educational Outreach Program in 2023, National Finalist in US Army eCybermission in 2021 (with a $4,000 prize), and Winner of the US Congressional App Challenge in 2021. Each one reminds me of the power of dedication.</p>

    <section id="volunteering">
        <h2>Giving Back Through Volunteering</h2>
        <p>Community is at my core. From 2023-2025, I've served on the National Youth Action Council for CADCA and the Youth Leadership Council for TxSDY, advocating for positive change. I was part of the US Army Educational Outreach Program Alumni Council from 2021-2024, the Frisco ISD District Advisory Council in 2023-2024, and the Frisco ISD Legislative Leadership Committee from 2021-2023. These roles have taught me leadership, empathy, and the importance of supporting others—skills I carry into every endeavor.</p>
